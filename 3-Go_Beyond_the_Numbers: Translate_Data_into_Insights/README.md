# Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights #

Course three of seven in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.

### Course Description: ###
This course focuses on uncovering narratives within datasets and effectively communicating those insights. Participants explore how storytelling enhances data comprehension and facilitates conveying key findings to colleagues and stakeholders. Through hands-on activities guided by Google professionals immersed in the field, learners refine their data analytics proficiencies, mastering exploratory data analysis techniques and crafting impactful data visualisations. By course completion, participants adeptly utilise Python tools for data examination and cleaning, transform categorical data into numerical formats, validate datasets, create accessible visualisations using Tableau, address missing data and outliers and manipulate date strings for effective data structuring and organisation.

#### Module 1: Find and Share Stories using Data ####
You’ll learn how to find the stories within data and share them with your audience. You’ll learn about the methods and benefits of data cleaning and how it can help you discover those stories. You’ll also go over the steps of the EDA process and learn how EDA can help you quickly understand data. Finally, you'll explore different ways to visualise data to communicate key insights.

#### Module 2: Explore Raw Data ####
Finding stories in data using EDA is all about organizing and interpreting raw data. Python can help you do this quickly and effectively. You’ll learn how to use Python to perform the EDA practices of discovering and sculpting.

#### Module 3: Clean your Data ####
You’ll explore three more EDA practices: cleaning, joining, and validating. You'll discover the importance of these practices for data analysis, and you’ll use Python to clean, validate, and join data.

#### Module 4: Data Visualisations and Presentations ####
You’ll practice creating and presenting data stories in an ethical, accessible, and professional way. You'll also explore advanced data visualisation techniques in Tableau.

#### Module 5: Course 3 End-of-Course Project ####
In this end-of-course project, you’ll practice using Python to perform EDA on a workplace scenario dataset. Then, you'll use Python and Tableau to visualise the data.
