# Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships #

Course five of seven in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.

### Course Description: ###
This course focuses on regression analysis — a vital tool for data professionals to uncover relationships between variables and elucidate factors influencing business performance. Participants delve into various data modelling techniques and their applications in solving business challenges, exploring methods such as linear regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and logistic regression. Guided by Google experts actively engaged in the field, learners engage in hands-on activities, real-world examples, and practical tasks aimed at refining their data analytics acumen. Upon completion, participants adeptly utilise predictive models to elucidate variable relationships, understand the nuances of multiple regression, conduct and interpret ANOVA tests, and construct diverse logistic regression models, including binomial, multinomial, ordinal, and Poisson log-linear regression models.

#### Module 1: Introduction to Complex Data Relationships ####
You’ll begin by exploring the main steps for building regression models, from identifying your assumptions to interpreting your results. Next, you’ll explore the two main types of regression: linear and logistic. You’ll learn how data professionals use linear and logistic regression to approach different kinds of business problems.

#### Module 2: Simple Linear Regression ####
You’ll explore how to use models to describe complex data relationships. You’ll focus on relationships of correlation. Then, you’ll build a simple linear regression model in Python and interpret your results.

#### Module 3: Multiple Linear Regression ####
After simple regression, you’ll move on to a more complex regression model: multiple linear regression. You’ll consider how multiple regression builds on simple linear regression at every step of the modelling process. You’ll also get a preview of some key topics in machine learning: selection, overfitting, and the bias-variance tradeoff.

#### Module 4: Advanced Hypothesis Testing ####
You’ll build on your prior knowledge of hypothesis testing to explore two more statistical tests: Chi-squared and analysis of variance (ANOVA). You’ll learn how data professionals use these tests to analyse different types of data. Finally, you’ll conduct two kinds of Chi-squared tests, as well as one-way and two-way ANOVA tests.

#### Module 5: Logistic Regression ####
You’ll investigate binomial logistic regression, a type of regression analysis that classifies data into two categories. You’ll learn how to build a binomial logistic regression model and how data professionals use this type of model to gain insights from their data.

#### Module 6: Course 5 End-of-Course Project ####
You’ll complete an end-of-course project by building a regression model to analyse a workplace scenario dataset.
