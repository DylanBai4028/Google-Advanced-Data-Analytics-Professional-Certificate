# The Power of Statistics #

Course four of seven in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.

### Course Description ###
This course, the fourth installment in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate series, delves into the application of statistics by data professionals to extract vital insights from data. Participants explore fundamental statistical concepts including descriptive and inferential statistics, probability theory, sampling methodologies, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. Through hands-on activities guided by Google practitioners immersed in the field, learners acquire proficiency in utilising Python for statistical analysis and effectively communicating their findings. Upon completion, participants adeptly articulate the role of statistics in data science, employ descriptive statistics for data summarisation and exploration, calculate probabilities and model data distributions, evaluate sampling methods and distributions, construct and interpret confidence intervals, and conduct hypothesis tests with confidence.

#### Module 1: Introduction to Statistics ####
You’ll explore the role of statistics in data science and identify the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. You’ll learn how descriptive statistics can help you quickly summarise a dataset and measure the centre, spread, and relative position of data.

#### Module 2: Probability ####
You’ll learn the basic rules for calculating probability for single events. Next, you’ll discover how data professionals use methods such as Bayes’ theorem to describe more complex events. Finally, you’ll learn how probability distributions such as the binomial, Poisson, and normal distribution can help you better understand the structure of data.

#### Module 3: Sampling ####
Data professionals use smaller samples of data to draw conclusions about large datasets. You’ll learn about the different methods they use to collect and analyze sample data and how they avoid sampling bias. You’ll also learn how sampling distributions can help you make accurate estimates.

#### Module 4: Confidence Intervals ####
You’ll explore how data professionals use confidence intervals to describe the uncertainty of their estimates. You'll learn how to construct and interpret confidence intervals — and how to avoid some common misinterpretations.

#### Module 5: Introduction to Hypothesis Testing ####
Hypothesis testing helps data professionals determine if the results of a test or experiment are statistically significant or due to chance. You’ll learn about the basic steps for any hypothesis test and how hypothesis testing can help you draw meaningful conclusions about data.

#### Module 6: Course 4 End-of-Course Project ####
In this end-of-course project, you’ll use statistical methods such as hypothesis testing to analyse a workplace scenario dataset.
