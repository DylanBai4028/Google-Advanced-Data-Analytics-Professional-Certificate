#### Module 1: The Different Types of Machine Learning ####
You’ll start by exploring the basic concepts of machine learning and the role of machine learning in data science. Then, you’ll review the four main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and deep learning.

#### Module 2: Workflow for Building Complex Models ####
You’ll learn how data professionals use a structured workflow for machine learning. You'll identify the main steps of the workflow and the importance of each step in the overall process. Then, you'll learn how to apply specific machine learning models to business problems.

#### Module 3: Unsupervised Learning Techniques ####
You’ll learn more about one of the major types of machine learning: unsupervised learning. You'll begin by exploring the difference between supervised and unsupervised techniques and the benefits and uses of each approach. Then, you’ll learn how to apply two unsupervised machine learning models: clustering and K-means.

#### Module 4: Tree-based Modelling ####
Next, you’ll focus on supervised learning. You’ll learn how to test and validate the performance of supervised machine learning models such as decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting.

#### Module 5: Course 6 End-of-Course Project ####
You’ll complete the final end-of-course project by applying different machine learning models to a workplace scenario dataset.
